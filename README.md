# finalProject


#Project about a Bao website was asked from a teacher at Generation USA, the project 
#is to show our knowledge on HTML, Bootstrap, GitBash, and GitHub. The project is open to anyone that wants it. 


#I didn't finish some things, like the SQL for keep data, or the javascript for cookies and automation, but for now the front end of the 
#project was made to the best of my knowledge. 


#Thanks
